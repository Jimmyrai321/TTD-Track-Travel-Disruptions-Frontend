## Project Brief
As we know in England, trains are plagued by delays and cancellations, the reliability of train services in England have been a significant concern. Data from the first half of 2025 revealed that 41% of train services were delayed by at least one minute and 3% were cancelled entirely. That's why we've created an app called Track Travel Disruptions. TTD aims to help commuters stay informed about their journey while only having to glance at the application. This app is especially useful for people who regularly utilise the same journey to commute to work, school or other destinations.
